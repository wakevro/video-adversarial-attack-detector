# Video Adversarial Attack Detector

## Description

This project is a tool for detecting adversarial attacks in videos using machine learning and image processing techniques. It processes video frames, applies adversarial attacks, detects them, and generates videos with detected frames decorated for easy visualization.

## Features

- Convert videos to frames and back to video.
- Apply adversarial attacks to video frames.
- Detect adversarial attacks in video frames.
- Decorate frames to highlight detected attacks.
- Save results and generate summary reports.
